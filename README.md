## Project Overview

- Dataset: UCI Heart Disease (heart_cleveland.csv)
- ML Model: Logistic Regression
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit
- Deployed with: Streamlit

---

## Model Training

Two models were trained:

| Model               | Accuracy Score  |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Decision Tree       | **0.77** (Best) |
| Logistic Regression | 0.73            |

The final deployed model is **Decision Tree** due to its balance of accuracy and interpretability.
